This is a clone of the Alibaba website, built using HTML and CSS. Please note that this project was created when I was still learning fundamental web development concepts. As a result, there are several important considerations to keep in mind:

No Flexbox Usage: At the time of development, I wasn't familiar with Flexbox, so layout management is done with older techniques that may not be as efficient or flexible.

Non-Responsive Design: The project lacks responsiveness, meaning it may not display correctly on various screen sizes and devices. This is something to consider if you plan to use or view the project.

CSS Practices: Since I was new to CSS, the code may contain some non-optimal practices. There could be better ways to structure and style the layout using more modern approaches.

Despite these limitations, I put a lot of effort into building this project, and it represents an important step in my learning journey. I hope it can be useful or insightful, whether you're looking to understand the basics of web development or considering improvements for your own projects.

Please feel free to provide feedback, as it will help me improve my skills further.
